### Matrix Multiplication Springboot-GRPC Application
  
This application allows you to perform matrix multiplication for square matrices (of power 2), across GRPC servers, by sending requests through a REST interface.

#### Notes
Submit a nxn matrix where n is a power of 2 via a POST request. Some example files are provided in the 'Matrix files' folder.
The file 'ips.txt' from grpc-client, is a file where you can store IP Addresses for servers.
